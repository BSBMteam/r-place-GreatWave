"description": "The Great Wave off Kanagawa, also known as The Great Wave or The Wave, is a world-famous woodblock print created in 1831 by the Japanese ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai (葛飾北斎). This was the first of the Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji. Three boats sail off the coast of Sagami Bay, Kanagawa Prefecture (神奈川県相模湾). During r/place, our wave was destroyed 3 times, first by infamous French streamer xqc (replaced by Super Meat Boy) and then attacked twice by Russian streamer dmitry_lixxx (replaced by blue void, then blackout). With the help of an overlay and support from Germany, Tunisia, and many more factions, we were able to quickly rebuild our artwork each time!",
